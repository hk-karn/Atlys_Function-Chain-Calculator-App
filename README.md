# Atlys_Function-Chain-Calculator-App
This is a task given by Atlys to understand my skillset of joining Atlys.
Problem Statement : A web application that allows users to execute a chain of 5 mathematical functions, with the output (y) of each function serving as the input (x) for the next.

And, For setting up the application in local, follow the below steps:
1. Prerequisites
    - Node.js
    - npm or Yarn (Package Manager)

    ```bash
    https://github.com/hk-karn/Atlys_Function-Chain-Calculator-App.git
    ```
    - Install the dependencies

     ```

## Tech Stack
- React.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS(Learning and using it for the first time)
- Vite (For Local Development Server - Learning and using it for the first time)
- Vercel (For deploying the application - Learning and using it for the first time)

## üìù Usage

1. Enter an initial value in the "Initial value of x" input
2. Modify function expressions in any of the function cards
3. Watch as calculations automatically update through the chain
4. Final result appears in the "Final Output y" display

### Valid Expression Examples

- `x^2`
- `2x+4`
- `x/2`
- `x-2`
- `x^2+20`
